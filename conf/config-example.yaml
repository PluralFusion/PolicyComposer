# --- Advanced Version History Control ---
#
# This system supports two types of versioning:
# 1. Global Releases (Recommended):
#    To stamp ALL documents with a new version, simply update the
#    'release_version' variable below. The action will detect this change
#    and create a new, official GitHub Release with your PDFs.
# 2. Hotfixes (For single files):
#    To add a version to just *one* file, commit your change to that file
#    using the 'release_commit_prefix' (e.g., "RELEASE: Fixed typo").
#
# This value is the *current* official version of the policy set.
# Updating this (e.g., from "v1.0.0" to "v1.1.0") will trigger
# a new global release for ALL documents.
release_version: "v1.0.0"

# This prefix is for "hotfix" commits that only apply to a *single* file.
# It is ignored during a global 'release_version' change.
release_commit_prefix: "RELEASE:"
