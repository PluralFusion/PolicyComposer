# --- Version Control ---
# This value is the *current* official version of the policy set.
# Updating this (e.g., from "v1.0.0" to "v1.1.0") triggers a new global release for ALL documents.
release_version: "v0.0.1"

# This prefix is for "hotfix" commits that only apply to a *single* file.
# It is ignored during a global 'release_version' change.

# --- Version History Display ---
# Controls whether the Git version history table appears in generated documents.

# On a global release, should the new version REPLACE all previous history,
# or be APPENDED to it?
# - "append" (default): Adds the new global release to the top of existing hotfixes, maintaining a full audit trail.
# - "replace": Wipes all previous history and shows only the new global release, useful for major revisions.
global_release_history_style: "append"

# --- Content Toggles ---
# Set to true to show sections wrapped in {% if show_internal_notes %} in the final documents.
