# Examples of Jinja2 support in these documents

The configuration values for the [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) portions of these documents are found in `/conf/config.yaml`

The github workflow/action script also supports Jinja2 for filenames. For example, if `/conf/config.yaml` contains:  
```yaml
company: Acme
```
then changing the filename:

   `/policies/introduction.md` 

to 

  `/policies/{{ company }}_introduction.md` 

should create the following output filenames:

* `/pdf/Acme_introduction.pdf`
* `/md/Acme_introduction.md`
