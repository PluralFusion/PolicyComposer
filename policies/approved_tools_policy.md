# Approved Tools Policy

Pact utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal Protected Health Information (PHI)-related use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by Pact, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity.  All software that cannot be used for tasks relating to PHI is specifically noted in a separate list. Use of other tools for tasks potentially involving PHI requires approval from Pact leadership.

## List of Approved Tools for use with Protected Health Information
