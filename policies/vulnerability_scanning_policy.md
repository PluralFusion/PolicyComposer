## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* {{ vulnerability_scanner.name }} management is performed by the {{ company }} Security Officer with assistance from the VP of Engineering.
* {{ vulnerability_scanner.name }} is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on {{ company }} networks.
* Frequency of scanning is as follows:
	1. on a weekly basis;
	2. after every production deployment.
* Reviewing {{ vulnerability_scanner.name }} reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the {{ company }} Security Officer.
* In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
	* All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
	* Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, VP of Engineering, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by {{ company }}.
		* Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
		* Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the {{ company }} Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by {{ company }}.
* Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the {{ company }} vulnerability management policy.
{% if audit_penetration_external %}
	* External penetration testing is performed {{ audit_penetration_external.frequency }} by {{ audit_penetration_external.auditor_name }}.
{% endif %}
{% if audit_penetration_internal %}
	* Internal penetration testing is performed {{ audit_penetration_internal.frequency }}.
{% endif %}
* {{ company }}
	* Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the {{ company }} Security Officer.
	* Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by {{ company }}.
* This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
