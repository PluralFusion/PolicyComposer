### Intrusion Detection and Vulnerability Scanning

* Production Systems are monitors using IDS systems. Suspicious activity is logged and alerts are generated.
* Vulnerability scanning of Production Systems must occur on a predetermined, regular basis, no less than annually. Currently it is weekly. Scans are reviewed by Security Officer, with defined steps for risk mitigation, and retained for future reference.

### Production System Security

* System, network, and server security is managed and maintained by the VP of Engineering and the Security Officer.
