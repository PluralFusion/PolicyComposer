## Configuration Management Controls

1. **Vulnerability Management**
   * {{ vulnerability_scanner.name }} by {{ vulnerability_scanner.provider }} is used to {{ vulnerability_scanner.functions }}.
   * Scans are performed regularly to detect unauthorized changes or malicious software.

2. **Change Management**
   * All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls require approval from the {{ security_officer_name }} before implementation.
   * Changes must be tested in development and staging environments before production deployment.
   * All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication through our {{ change_request_form_link }}.

3. **System Inventory and Documentation**
   * An up-to-date inventory of systems is maintained using approved collaboration tools.
   * Systems are categorized based on criticality and data classification.
   * Architecture diagrams and system documentation are stored in approved document management systems.

4. **Development Practices**
   * Code changes are managed through {{ approved_tools.development[0].name }} with mandatory code reviews.
   * Pull requests are required for all code changes to ensure quality and security.
   * Development, staging, and production environments are maintained with consistent configurations.

5. **System Security**
   * All front-end functionality is separated from backend systems through appropriate network segmentation.
   * System clocks are synchronized using NTP, with restricted access to time modifications.
   * Security tools are implemented across all systems:
{% for vendor in security_vendors %}
     * {{ vendor }} for security monitoring and threat detection
{% endfor %}

6. **Infrastructure Management**
   * Cloud infrastructure is provided by:
{% for vendor in platform_vendors %}
     * {{ vendor }}{% if vendor in baa_vendors %} (BAA in place){% endif %}
{% endfor %}
   * Data storage is managed by:
{% for vendor in data_storage_vendors %}
     * {{ vendor }}{% if vendor in baa_vendors %} (BAA in place){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

7. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   * System monitoring is provided by:
{% for vendor in monitoring_vendors %}
     * {{ vendor }}
{% endfor %}

8. **Operating System Standards**
   * Server deployments are restricted to:
{% for os_type, versions in approved_os.servers.items() %}
{% for version in versions %}
     * {{ version.name }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

9. **Deployment Schedule**
   * Production deployments follow a regular schedule with proper change management procedures.
   * Emergency changes follow an expedited approval process while maintaining security controls.
