# {{ company }} IDS Policy

In order to preserve the integrity of data that {{ company }} stores, processes, or transmits for Customers, {{ company }} implements comprehensive intrusion detection and security monitoring through multiple layers of security tools and services.

## Security Monitoring Infrastructure

1. Primary Security Tools:
{% if security_vendors %}
{% for vendor in security_vendors %}
   * {{ vendor }} for advanced threat detection and response
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

2. System Monitoring:
{% if monitoring_vendors %}
{% for vendor in monitoring_vendors %}
   * {{ vendor }} for performance and availability monitoring
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

3. Vulnerability Management:
   * {{ vulnerability_scanner.name }} by {{ vulnerability_scanner.provider }} for {{ vulnerability_scanner.functions }}
