# Third-Party Content Complaint & Takedown Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy provides a formal process for {{ company_name }}("Company") to respond to any third-party allegation that content created, displayed, or published on Company-controlled platforms (including websites, applications, and marketing materials) is libelous, infringes on copyright or trademark, or violates an individual's privacy rights.

The goal of this policy is to ensure a prompt, consistent, and legally-sound response to all such complaints, to mitigate legal and reputational risk, and to comply with applicable laws (including the DMCA).

## 2. Designated Point of Contact

All complaints and allegations covered by this policy must be submitted in writing to the Company's designated legal contact.

- Designated Contact: Legal Department

- Designated Email: {{ legal_email }} 

This single point of contact is critical for tracking and managing all claims.

## 3. Procedure for All Employees

**DO NOT RESPOND TO THE COMPLAINANT.**

- Any employee (e.g., in sales, support, or management) who receives a complaint of this nature—whether by email, phone, or social media—must not reply, apologize, or make any admission.

- The employee's only action is to immediately forward the complete, original complaint and all related information to the Designated Email {{ legal_email }} and notify their manager.

## 4. Takedown & Response Process

This process is managed only by the Designated Contact (in consultation with the CEO and legal counsel).

### Step 1: Complaint Intake

The Designated Contact receives the written complaint. The complaint must, at a minimum:

- Identify the person making the complaint (the "Complainant").

- Clearly identify the specific content at issue (e.g., provide a URL, a screenshot).

- State the legal basis for the complaint (e.g., "This is my copyrighted photo," "This statement is libelous," "This violates my privacy").

### Step 2: Triage & Acknowledgment

The Designated Contact will immediately review the complaint for validity and send a simple, non-committal acknowledgment to the Complainant.

- Sample Response: "We have received your complaint and are reviewing the matter. We take these issues seriously and will follow up as our process continues."

- Do not admit fault, apologize, or promise any specific outcome.

### Step 3: Immediate Mitigation (Removal)

This is the most critical step to limit liability.

- For Copyright Claims (DMCA): The Company will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material. This is a mandatory step under the DMCA to maintain "safe harbor" protection.

- For Libel or Privacy Claims: The Designated Contact will make a good-faith assessment. The safest course of action is to temporarily remove the challenged content pending a full investigation. This action is not an admission of guilt but a step to mitigate potential damages.

### Step 4: Investigation

The Designated Contact (with the CEO and relevant department head, like Marketing or Product) will:

- Confirm the location and nature of the challenged content.

- Determine the source of the content (Was it created by an employee? A contractor? Sourced from a third-party?).

- Review the legal claim (e.g., Is it "fair use"? Is the statement factually true? Is the information a matter of public record?).

- Consult with legal counsel to determine the Company's liability and best course of action.

### Step 5: Resolution & Final Action

Based on the investigation and legal advice, the Company will decide on a final action:

- Claim is Valid: The content will be permanently removed, modified to correct the issue, or replaced with compliant content.

- Claim is Invalid (Copyright): The Company may follow the DMCA "counter-notification" process, which allows the content to be restored after a waiting period if the Complainant does not file a lawsuit.

- Claim is Invalid (Libel/Privacy): Legal counsel will advise on whether to restore the content or keep it down to avoid litigation risk.

### Step 6: Final Notification

The Designated Contact will send a final, written response to the Complainant informing them of the Company's decision (e.g., "We have permanently removed the content" or "Following an investigation, our legal review determined the content does not violate your rights.").
